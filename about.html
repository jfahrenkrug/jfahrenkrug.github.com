<p class="bigtext">
  I started programming when I was 12. That's 16 years ago and I still love it. 
</p>
  
<ul class="bigtext">
  <li>I've been freelancing since early 2007.</li>
  <li>I develop Mac, iPhone and iPad software.</li>
  <li>I also build stunning rich web applications with <a class="swbluelink" href="http://cappuccino.org">Cappuccino</a> and JavaScript.</li>
  <li>I am very active in the <a class="swbluelink" href="http://github.com/jfahrenkrug">open source community</a>.</li>
  <li>I frequently attend and speak at conferences. Say hi when you're there, too.</li>
  <li>I teach and coach (and I'm a nice guy): So ask me when you want to get started with iPhone/Mac/Cappuccino/Ruby development.</li>
  <li>I do security consulting. I've found security holes on <a class="swbluelink" href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302530">Apple</a>'s and <a class="swbluelink" href="http://www.google.com/corporate/security.html">Google</a>'s websites.</li>
  <li>I like <a class="swbluelink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J---aiyznGQ">animals</a> and <a class="swbluelink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYU7oG2V7uc">good music</a>.</li>
</ul>
