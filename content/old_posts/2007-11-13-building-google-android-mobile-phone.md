The new <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Google Android SDK</a> and platform seems to be quite impressive! 
This is a video from a refreshingly geeky Google developer - Dan Morrill - building a simple Android applicationg in roughly 8 minutes. He uses Eclipse and Java to build it. It seems to be pretty cool and the SDK even comes with a nice emulator.
