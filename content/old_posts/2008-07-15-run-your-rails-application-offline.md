I just read about a cool project over at the <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/07/take-your-rails-application-offline.html">Google Code Blog</a>. Two graduates from NYU have created a Rails plugin called Gears on Rails or acts_as_local. It uses <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> for local data storage so you can run your Rails application offline. From the website:

<blockquote>Gears on Rails helps developers to write fully offline functionnal web applications based on Gears without learning a bit of Gears.</blockquote>

That sounds very cool. The website has a demo so you can dive into the code right away. This might be a nice alternative to <a href="http://joyent.com/developers/slingshot/">Slingshot</a>, although Slingshot also hides the Ruby requirements from the user and packages everything up nicely, something Gears On Rails doesn't do. But it shouldn't be too hard to implement a Slingshot clone based on Gears On Rails. We'll see.
