I went back in forth in my mind a lot about whether I should attend the <a href="http://www.richinternet.de/index.cfm?F55845B1050BC22E0F1A8E4DF49D424C">Adobe Flex 3 Roadshow 2008 in Hamburg</a> this morning or not. I decided to attend. I was stuck in traffic for about 30 minutes so it took me over 1:30 hours to get there. The event started off with a short presentation about Adobe, then a short presentation about the Herrlich &amp; Ramuschkat GmbH and finally a longer presentation about Flex Builder 3. I found out quickly that this was an event for people who have never heard of Flex and have no idea what it is. The demo showed a Hello World example, a grid, an HBox, a VBox, a Tab Control, and a simple data binding example: All stuff that I had seen or done before. I asked one question about testing and it turns out that Flex Builder does NOT come with any (unit-) testing support. That is rather disappointing.
I left at the lunch break and didn't stay for the two short sessions on AIR and BlazeDS. I was hoping for some more developer-oriented material and some in-depth information. I would have learned more about Flex and AIR if I would have used the time at home trying out examples, reading the docs and watching some screencasts. Oh, and they were even out of coffee when I came... I did get a nice pen, though.
