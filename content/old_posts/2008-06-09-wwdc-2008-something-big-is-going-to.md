I picked up <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26767281@N06/2563126707/">my badge</a> today because last year I had to stand in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/armyant/633496662/in/photostream/">this huge line</a> twice on Monday morning: once to pick up my badge and once to actually get in. Since this year's WWDC is sold out I wanted to make sure to at least register and pick up my badge and swag the day before.
The t-shirt surprised me a bit. This is a close up of the print on the front:

Three iPhone icons indicating 10 am on June 9th at the Moscone Center: the time of tomorrow's keynote. Does this mean that the keynote is going to be so big that you'll need a t-shirt saying "I was there"? Well, it definitely is another hint towards a landmark event. Will the 3G iPhone be the only big thing? I don't think so because it's no surprise anymore that it will be announced. So I suppose we'll have to wait and see.  I can't deny a certain excitement :)!
Here are some more pictures:
