I'm in Salon 4 at the <a href="http://www.maritim.de/typo3/english/hotels/hotels/proarte-hotel-berlin.html">Maritim pro Arte hotel</a> in Berlin waiting for the Community Code Drive to begin at 10. Yesterday's Bratwurst on Rails event was fun. It was raining really hard, though and in my opinion they were a little stingy with the prizes. I was able to meet a couple of developer friends and make some new ones. It was interesting to meet some guys from ELC Tech (please note: you pronounce every single letter of ELC, the company has nothing to do with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk">animal</a>) and I even saw their CEO, who I had a few phone conversations with earlier this year, so I'm looking forward to meeting him in person. I got home around midnight, so here are a few blurry pictures I took:
