Most of you might have heard about Google's Social Networking API <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a>. Rocketboom has a very easy to understand explanation of what it is:

 <object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2F473464&amp;brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Erocketboom%2Ecom&amp;brandname=Rocketboom&amp;showsharebutton=true&amp;showguidebutton=false&amp;showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf" allowfullscreen="true" id="showplayer" height="270" width="432"><param name="movie" value="http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2F473464&amp;brandlink=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Erocketboom%2Ecom&amp;brandname=Rocketboom&amp;showsharebutton=true&amp;showguidebutton=false&amp;showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf"><param name="quality" value="best"></object>

I think it's a good idea - especially because both Xing and LinkedIn are supporting it (who didn't wish that you could share your contacts between those two sites?). On the other hand it's a little scary that even more data  about the user is being collected and shared.
