It's Wednesday. I'm in the "Making Your Application Scriptable" session right now. Yesterday night the Apple Design Awards and "Stump the Experts" took place which was a lot of fun. I got up to the mic too but just before I wanted to ask my question the event was over. Oh well, I'll try again next year.<br />I'm not quite sure which sessions I'll go to today. I'll post again when I know. I'll listen to the session now :)...<br /><br />Silverlight</a>. It was very interesting to talk to him about this cool technology. I always wanted to know if the client had to have Python installed if you choose to write your Silverlight app in Python. The answer is no: The Python interpreter is built into the Silverlight runtime. Very cool.<br />After lunch I went to "Unlocking the Potential of Dashcode". I have played around with Dashcode a bit and it is really impressive. I think I'll have to build my first Widget soon.<br />After that I went to see "Getting Started with Xray". That was the most impressive session on day 3. Xray is a-ma-zing!<br />The last session was "Integrating QuickTime Support into Your Application with QTKit" and it was definitely worth attending. I still have a few questions which I'm going to ask today at the QTKit Lab.<br />On the way home with the Caltrain I met a "GCC Engineer" from Apple. What a cool job  title! It was very interesting to talk to him about working on such an important and complex open source project as GCC. He is giving a talk about "Compiler Advances" this afternoon which I'm going to check out. He said the title is too generic so probably no one will turn up ;-) We'll see...
