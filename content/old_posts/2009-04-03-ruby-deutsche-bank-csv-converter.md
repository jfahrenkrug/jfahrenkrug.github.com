I've recently signed up with <a href="http://www.freeagentcentral.com/?referrer=31l92b39">FreeAgentCentral</a>. It's a really great service, but it didn't like Deutsche Bank's CSV files. That's why I wrote a converter. <a href="http://github.com/jfahrenkrug/deutsche-bank-csv-converter/tree">Check it out on Github</a>.<div><br/>By the way, if you sign up with this link, you (and I ;)) will get a 10% discount:<br/> <a href="http://www.freeagentcentral.com/?referrer=31l92b39" title="FreeAgent: money management and accounting for freelancers, contractors and consultants"><img src="http://www.freeagentcentral.com/images/i-heart-fa.jpg" width="205" height="85" alt="FreeAgent sign-up" /></a>
