<p>I was invited to talk about <a href="/2011/09/thoughts-on-mobile-ui-design.html">mobile UI design</a> at this year's wonderful <a href="http://swdc.se">Scandinavian Web Developers Conference</a> in Stockholm. It was a great conference and I enjoyed it immensely! My talk was recorded and you can watch it right here in the comfort of your home!</p>
