Tim Burks</a> in this session (no surprises here) and we could talk about Nu and Nu on the iPhone. It's always great to meet up with the people you know online in person.<br />The evening consisted of the Apple Design Awards and Stump The Experts. And guess what? I stumped the experts! Well, at least I got a prize and the shirt which is really cool.<br />I actually just wanted to solve a song and a guy in front of me was faster... but I just stayed in line anyway, waiting to be humiliated. But luckily, Fred asked who was in line just because they were brave and I raised my hand along with 3 other guys. So all four of us solved a question together and all got a prize and the prestigious stump t-shirt. Very nice!<br /><br />So this was a great and fun day and today will be no different, I'm sure!
