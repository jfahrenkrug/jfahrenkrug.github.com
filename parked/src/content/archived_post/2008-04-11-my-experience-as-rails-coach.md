It's Thursday night and I'm typing this at the Munich airport waiting for my flight to Hamburg. I've spent the last 3 days in Bavaria helping two talented PHP developers getting started with Ruby on Rails. It was fun.
On the first day I gave a brief introduction to OOP and TDD along with a quick Rails overview. Then we started coding. We set up Subversion, and coded two demo projects by noon, touching on RESTful design and scaffolding, migrations, MVC, tests, and the joy of having ActiveRecord do all the dirty CRUD work. One of the developers then told me that they were very sceptic at first as to why Rails would improve or speed up their development in comparison to PHP. But those few hours already had convinced him why. That was a very satisfying experience.
On the second day the same developer had the idea of following through the Depot application demo from the AWDWR book and recording what I do as a screencast. That was a great idea. So we started with the Depot application from scratch, using the new Rails 2.0 way of doing things where necessary or where it made sense. We got to the end of Task C on page 109 on the first day and finished the complete Depot application today with testing and all.
So in 3 days we covered A LOT of ground and I have screencasts of developing the whole Depot application with Rails 2. They are pretty raw and they are in German, but they might be helpful to some (if you don't mind my stinking slow iBook and my lame jokes along the way). I'm thinking about making them available on my blog soon.
Well, the bottom line is Rails is great and in 3 days you can give a great introduction to this framework with quite a bit of in-depth information.

<p style="margin-left: 30px">To reduce the required time for modeling a transaction support is planned so that one user interaction can lead to complex editor operations.<BR/>From the conceptual point of view ModuleStudio is not limited to PostNuke. A model contains mainly general MVC terminology. With several different generator cartridges it could become possible to generate multiple kinds of applications from one single model.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Hey Steffen!<BR/><BR/>One of the developers had experience with the Zend Framework. Of course MVC isn't anything new, but an important puzzle piece if you start with any MVC framework. Modulestudio.de looks interesting, but it seems to be limited to PostNuke. I don't like PHP very much and I'm not sure if graphically modelling your app is always the fastest way to go, especially if the grow more complex. I think WebObjects has this capability for your model classes as well, so that might be interesting, too.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Didn't they use a framework before? I mean: MVC is not a Rails invention and scaffolding is not rocket science... :-D<BR/><BR/>You should check out http://modulestudio.de - THAT is the future of programming. And once the system does what Axel plans to implement you will never have to adjust your code for new core versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Thanks for your time Johannes. It was a really great experience to get all the basic stuff of ruby on rails. I'm sure we'll create a perfect rails application with your help. Keep on your great work.<BR/><BR/>Regards Florian</p>
