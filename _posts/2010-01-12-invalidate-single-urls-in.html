title: Invalidate Single URLs in Rack::Cache/Radiant::Cache

I've recently encountered a problem with Rack::Cache: I have a Radiant app with some custom extensions and some of those extensions build pages that are expensive to build. So far I could only purge the cache completely by removing the tmp/cache directory. That's not a nice solution if all I want to invalidate is one page. So after some digging I came up with this tiny script:<br />
<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/275240.js?file=clear_diskcache.rb">
</script><br />
<br />
It allows me to explicitly purge certain URLs from my Rack::Cache based Radiant::Cache. Please note that this only works if you use the Radiant::Cache standard options. Otherwise you'll have to tweak the metastore that should be used.<br />
