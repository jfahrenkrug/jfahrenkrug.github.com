I found it extremely tedious to define the vertices of sprites for the Box2D or Chipmunk physics engines. Maybe I was just not using the right tool. So I wrote my own. It's called VertexHelper and it lets you graphically define vertices of sprites for Box2D and Chipmunk bodies/shapes. You can <a href="http://github.com/jfahrenkrug/VertexHelper">find it on github</a>.<br />
This video shows you what it does and how it works:<br />

<br/>Very appreciate that you built such an app for free.<br /><br />Just to mention that you may need to do some conversions between CGRect and NSRect, CGPoint and NSPoint.<br /><br />eg in your code:<br />-(CALayer *)hitTest:(NSPoint)aPoint<br /><br />NSPointInRect(aPoint,[self bounds])<br /><br />is better to use the following<br /><br />NSPointInRect(aPoint,NSRectFromCGRect([self bounds]))<br /><br />Nice app!! I like it a lot!!<br/>

<br/>This is great (I just wish it had been around a couple months ago). Well done!<br/>
