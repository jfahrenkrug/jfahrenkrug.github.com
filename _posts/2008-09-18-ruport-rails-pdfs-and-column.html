I'm currently working on a Rails project that needs to generate Report PDFs. <a href="http://rubyreports.org/">Ruport</a>, of course, is an obvious choice for this task. It took me a little bit to get used to how Ruport does things (read: wants you to do things). I don't want to dive too deep into getting started with Ruport. If you're new to it, check out these two great guides: <a href="http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/ruport/trac.cgi/wiki/DimwitsGuide">The Dimwit's Guide</a> and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/ruby/2008/04/08/ruport-business-reporting-for-ruby.html">O'Reilly Network Ruport Guide</a>. Please note, however, that the tutorials and guides often mention "Renderers": they are called "Controllers" in the current version of Ruport. Just keep that in mind.
So back to my PDF columns problem: I wanted to be able to have all the text in the first column left-aligned and the text in all the other columns right-aligned. This turned out to be a little harder than I thought.
Let's do this step by step (I assume you have installed the Ruport Gem and it's dependencies). This will also show you how to use Ruport in your Rails app without acts_as_reportable:
<ol><li>Create a "reports" directory inside your app directory.</li><li>Add it to your Rails load path by adding this inside the Rails::Initializer.run block in your environment.rb:<pre class="prettyprint">
config.load_paths += %W( #{RAILS_ROOT}/app/reports )</pre></li><li>For the next step, we assume to have class that looks something like this:
<pre class="prettyprint">
class MyReport &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :report_title, :report_subtitle

  # ColumnHeader has an attribute "name"
  has_many :column_headers

  # We assume they come in the right order, and a row has_many columns.
  # A Column has an attribute "value"
  has_many :rows
end
</pre>
So we see our report can have n rows with n columns and two attributes: "report_title" and "report_subtitle".</li><li>Create a file called "my_report_renderer.rb" in your app/reports directory.</li><li>Put this in the file:<pre class="prettyprint">require 'ruport'

class MyReportRenderer &lt; Ruport::Controller
  stage :report_header, :report_body
  finalize :report

  class PDF &lt; Ruport::Formatter::PDF
    renders :pdf, :for =&gt; MyReportRenderer

    def build_report_header
      # data is an instance of your MyReport class
      add_text "My Great Report", :font_size =&gt; 20,
              :justification =&gt; :center
      add_text data.report_title, :font_size =&gt; 18
      add_text data.report_subtitle, :font_size =&gt; 16
    end

    def build_report_body
      # we have to build the table
      headers = []

        
      # gather the column header strings in an array
      data.column_headers.each do |ch|
        headers &lt;&lt; ch.name
      end


      table = Table(headers) do |t|
        data.rows.each do |row|
          columns = []

          # gather the actual column values for each row in an array       
          row.columns.each do |col|
            columns &lt;&lt; col.value
          end

          # add the columns for the current row to the table
          t &lt;&lt; columns
        end
      end

      # create column option that right justify all columns but the first one
      col_opts = {}
      header_index = 0
      for header_index in (0..(headers.length - 1))
        # we'll skip the first one, since :left is the default
        if header_index != 0
          # the options for each column are indexed by it's name (headers array)
          col_opts[headers[header_index]] = {:justification =&gt; :right}
        end
      end

      pad (20) { draw_table(table, :column_options =&gt; col_opts) }
    end

    def finalize_report
      render_pdf
    end
  end
end</pre>OK, now we have a renderer (or controller) that renders our report with all columns right-justified except for the first one.</li><li>Now just add an action to your MyReport Rails controller:<pre class="prettyprint">def download_pdf
  begin
    @report = MyReport.find(params[:id]) 
    send_data(MyReportRenderer.render(:pdf, :data =&gt; @report),
          :filename =&gt; "report#{params[:id]}.pdf",
          :type =&gt; "application/pdf",
          :dispostion =&gt; 'inline')
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    flash[:error] = "Report not found."
    redirect_to :action =&gt; :index
  end
end</pre></li><li>That's it.
</li></ol>I didn't actually try this code: it's modified (simplified) code from the app I'm working on, but it should work. If not, please leave a comment.
