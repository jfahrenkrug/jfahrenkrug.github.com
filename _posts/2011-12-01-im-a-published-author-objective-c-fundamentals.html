<p>Over a year ago the publisher Manning asked me to come aboard a book project: <a href="http://www.manning.com/fairbairn/">Objective-C Fundamentals</a>. I ended up writing 3 chapters (about Core Data, GCD &amp; blocks and Error &amp; Exception Handling). It was an interesting experience and a lot of work. You can <a href="http://www.manning.com/fairbairn/OCF_sample_ch13.pdf">download the chapter about GCD &amp; blocks for free here (PDF)</a>. And you can find the <a href="https://github.com/ChrisTec/iPhone-Book-CodeSamples">source code for all of the book's projects on Github</a>.</p>
