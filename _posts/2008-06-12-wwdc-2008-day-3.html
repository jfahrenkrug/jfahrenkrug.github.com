Yesterday was a very interesting, successful and fun WWDC day. I first attended iPhone Application User Interface Design: an extremely interesting session on bringing the best experience to your users. It was a good session choice. After that I went down to the Ruby On Rails lab. I was able to ask some deployment and performance questions and met two very talented and resourceful Apple Rails developers. We went in-depth on my questions and I brought my code which was helpful. The good information is that I was on the right track with the solutions I had in mind. And I was introduced to <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">HAML</a> which I'll check out for sure.<br />Then I attended the lunch time session called Small Teams, Complex Pipelines: Writing Software at Pixar by Dr. Michael B. Johnson which was both entertaining and informative. Lots of similarities between artists and developers and quite a few funny Pixar anecdotes which my confidentiality agreements doesn't allow me to talk about ;-).<br />After that I checked into my hotel which is just around the block from Moscone West. Parc 55 is a very nice hotel and in a nice area, right in the center.<br />My first afternoon session was Internationalizing Your Software, nothing exciting but important stuff to know. Then I went down to a Foundation Lab to ask about Web Services and finally attended Cocoa Development Using Scripting about using scripting languages like Ruby to develop Cocoa apps. A very high quality, in-depth and fast paced session. A definite highlight of the conference.<br />I met <a href="http://blog.neontology.com/">Tim Burks</a> in this session (no surprises here) and we could talk about Nu and Nu on the iPhone. It's always great to meet up with the people you know online in person.<br />The evening consisted of the Apple Design Awards and Stump The Experts. And guess what? I stumped the experts! Well, at least I got a prize and the shirt which is really cool.<br />I actually just wanted to solve a song and a guy in front of me was faster... but I just stayed in line anyway, waiting to be humiliated. But luckily, Fred asked who was in line just because they were brave and I raised my hand along with 3 other guys. So all four of us solved a question together and all got a prize and the prestigious stump t-shirt. Very nice!<br /><br />So this was a great and fun day and today will be no different, I'm sure!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-5638120293948355050?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
