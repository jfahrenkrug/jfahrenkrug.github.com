After being up for 23 hours I finally arrived in San Francisco. The trip was smooth and I met a girl who's learning German sign language, a scientist heading to a conference in San Diego (who happened to be a Mac user) and a professor who can read Hebrew. Lots of interesting people.
Close friends of mine from San Jose picked me up and our first stop was <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-N-Out Burger</a> - one of the best burger joints in California.
Tomorrow I have one more day to spend with my friends and relax a bit before the WWDC starts on Monday!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-6832078149184727137?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
