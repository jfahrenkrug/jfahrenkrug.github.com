I just received the new <a href="http://developer.apple.com/adcnews/index.html">ADC newsletter</a> and it had a link to a very nice tutorial for <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/developonrailsleopard.html">developing Ruby on Rails</a><img src="http://www.wildlife-tour-india.com/gifs/snow-leopard.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; width: 155px; height: 137px;" title="leopard" alt="leopard" /> <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/developonrailsleopard.html">applications on Leopard</a>. There are heaps of RoR tutorials out there, but in my experience tutorials written by the Apple folks are of an above average quality. 
Another interesting thing about this tutorial is that it uses XCode 3.0 instead of my (and I guess most people's) Mac text editor of choice, <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>. It's the first of three parts. So to whom it may concern, it might be an interesting read.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-6242081239188109221?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
