The answer seems to be yes! As I just read in a DDJ newsletter, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/rruth/www/">Ruth Rosenholtz</a> of MIT is <a href="http://web.mit.edu/rruth/www/clutter.htm">doing just that</a>. You can <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/37593">download the code</a> but by taking just a quick look I couldn't find a Makefile or build instructions. I didn't look very hard, though.Pr Well, let's give the project some more time, but I think the idea is very interesting. A lot of UIs are cluttered and not very intuitive for the user to work with. Any attempt to make better and easier UIs is a step in the right direction. I must say though that learning how to make good UIs makes more sense - from a developer's point of view - than to detect if an UI is cluttered once it's done. An approach used by Apple is <a href="http://www.paperprototyping.com/">Paper Prototyping</a>, for example.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-6385015157323535768?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
