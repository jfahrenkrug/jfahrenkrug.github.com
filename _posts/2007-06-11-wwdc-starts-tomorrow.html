<img src="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/images/citlogopart.gif" border="0"> I used today to get some shopping done at the <a href="http://westfield.com/valleyfair/">Valley Fair</a> mall in Santa Clara. It's a very nice mall and I found a couple of nice things. I had to go to the Apple Store to check out the new MacBook Pros and the AppleTV, of course. Both are very nice, esp. the AppleTV because <a href="http://www.appletvhacks.net/">you can hack it</a> ;-).
We had dinner at <a href="http://www.gordonbiersch.com/restaurants/index.php?pg=location&sub=loc&amp;location_id=19">Gordon Biersch</a> in downtown San jose (<a href="http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/hamcam/">Livecam</a>). Nice atmosphere, the food was good and the beer was surprisingly good.
Well, I'll be taking the <a href="http://caltrain.com/">Caltrain</a> to San Francisco tomorrow morning at 5:45 AM because I still have to pick up my WWDC badge and I want to get a (good) seat for the keynote. So I guess I better go to bed and get some rest because I have a jam packed week of learning ahead of me!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-1471296084479501886?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
