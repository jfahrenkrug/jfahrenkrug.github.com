title: Ruby Tool To Check If WWDC 2010 Has Been Announced

Every Mac and iPhone developer is waiting for Apple to finally announce the dates of this year's WWDC. So to be the first to know when they announce it, <a href="http://gist.github.com/raw/350198/87b2e86b3f9b1b3597dbf1ca1752f835d592a764/wwdc2010.rb">I wrote a little ruby script</a> that checks the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc">WWDC website</a> for changes.<br />
The really cool thing is that it works with both MRI and <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>. But when you run it with MacRuby it uses HotCocoa and hence is much cooler:<br />

So here's the code:<br />
<br />

<br />
And you can <a href="http://gist.github.com/raw/350198/87b2e86b3f9b1b3597dbf1ca1752f835d592a764/wwdc2010.rb">download it here</a>.
