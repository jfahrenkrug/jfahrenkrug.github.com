With the release of the iPhone SDK and a whole track devoted to iPhone development this year's WWDC will be even more exciting, I'm sure. I've booked my ticket this weekend, so I'm pretty excited and I'll keep you and the other guy who's reading this updated.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-3040116830734822988?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
