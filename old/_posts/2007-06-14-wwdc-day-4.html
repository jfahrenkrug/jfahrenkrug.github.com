The Caltrain just passed the Mountain View station and I'm on my way to day 4 of the WWDC. Some very interesting sessions are waiting for me: First there's "Leopard User Interface Design." After that I'll go down to the QTKit Lab to ask if QTKit would be a good choice to develop an app to recognize multiple barcodes in a picture using for example <a href="http://zebra.sf.net">zebra</a>. If there's still time afterwards I might catch the end of the session "Developing Cocoa Applications with Python and Ruby."<br />In the afternoon I might go to either "Tracing Software Behavior with <a href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/">DTrace</a>" or "Creating Stunning Effects with Core Image." I'm very impressed by Xray and the session yesterday was great, so I might go see the DTrace session... I'm not sure yet. I can still watch whatever session I missed on the session DVDs that will be sent out to the attendees some time after the conference.<br />After that I'm going to see the session by the GCC Engineer I met on the Caltrain yesterday: "Taking Advantage of Compiler Advances" and I don't know about the last session yet. So it looks like it's going to be an extremely interesting day at the WWDC again!<br /><br />[Update]<br />I'm sitting in the waiting room of the San Francisco Caltrain station on the corner of 4th and King St. I was ingenious enough to manage to miss both the train that left at 7:20 PM and the one that left at 8:25 PM (because I thought it would leave at 8:35 PM...).<br />Today was a very interesting day nevertheless. The "Leopard User Interface Design" session was very good, lots of great UI guidelines that you can apply to almost any interface. After that I went to the QTKit Lab to ask about that barcode project: Turns out that QTKit would be a good fit for the problem (no surprises there). <br />At lunch I met a Mac developer from Google who works - among other things - on the GMail notifier which I use every day.<br />After lunch I decided to go to the Core Image session: a very good decision because I met an Apple engineer who could help me even further with my barcode problem. Then I went on to the "Compiler Advances" session. Some stuff was a bit over my head, but very interesting nonetheless. <br />I went to the WWDC Bash afterwards. I'll write more about it tomorrow. I'm on the train now, I'm tired and my battery is running low... as well as my laptops.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-7737911653083583663?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
