I've emailed the Apple security guys a while ago about a couple of XSS security holes on their websites. I almost forgot about it because I didn't get a message that said "Ok, it's fixed". Well, I just went to the <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201536">Apple Web Server notifications</a> page and what do you know? Two new entries thanking me for telling them about the XSS holes. Nice, so my count is up to 4 now on that page. Here's what they say:

 <blockquote>2007-09-26 education.apple.com

A cross-site scripting issue was addressed. We would like to acknowledge Johannes Fahrenkrug of Springenwerk Consulting for reporting the issue.
