Google is hosting a week of developer workshops about JavaScript, Google Gears, OpenSocial, and various other Google APIs. Of course they do this so more developers use their APIs so in turn more users use Google and their services. But is that so bad? Most other companies will charge you an arm and a leg to learn about their products and APIs. 
I hope they'll offer these workshops in Europe, too at one point. I'm still mad at myself for missing the Google Developer Day in Hamburg last year. Oh well. 
By the way, the workshops will be <a href="http://googleworkshops.googlemashups.com/">available online</a>.
