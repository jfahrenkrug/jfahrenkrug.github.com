It's a framework for creating rich internet applications (read: applications that run in the browser but that feel like a desktop application). The crazy thing is that it's not just some other framework, but it actually re-creates the beautiful <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa frameworks</a> in JavaScript. When I first heard this I thought it was crazy. I still do, but now I also think it's unbelievably cool because it actually works. Bringing the Cocoa frameworks to the browser is kind of like building a car out of matches and it actually drives. And looks good. And has airbags and a CD player. Awesome. OK, enough of that. How do you get started? Well, you could download the <a href="http://cappuccino.org/download/">starter package</a> but as a professional developer you probably want to correctly set up your development environment and be on the bleeding edge. That's why this tutorial assumes a few things: you have a Unix-based system, <a href="http://www.git-scm.org/">git</a>, and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> with <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> and <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a> installed. The following instructions are based on the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/280north/cappuccino/getting-and-building-the-source">official instructions</a> and don't aim to replace them, but possibly make them a little easier to follow. Here we go:<div></div><div><ol><li>Get the source: <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/280north/cappuccino.git</code></pre></li>
<li>Make a directory for the built products, for example I did: <pre><code>mkdir /Users/johannes/Code/capp_build</code></pre></li>
<li>Add $CAPP_BUILD to your .profile (or whatever you use) I did: <pre><code>export CAPP_BUILD=/Users/johannes/Code/capp_build</code></pre></li>
<li>Source it: <pre><code>source ~/.profile</code></pre></li>
<li>Build and install cappuccino: <pre><code>cd cappuccino &amp;&amp; sudo rake install</code></pre></li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ol><div></div><div>To update to the latest version, you can later just change into the cappuccino directory and run <pre><code>git pull</code></pre>and then <pre><code>sudo rake clobber-all install</code></pre></div></div><div>And if you use TextMate, you'll want to install the TextMate Objective-J bundle like so (in the cappuccino directory): <pre><code>open ./Build/Cappuccino/Tools/Editors/TextMate/JavaScript\ Objective-J.tmbundle</code></pre>One more optional thing you should do is set up your name in capp (the tool you'll use to generate new applications): <pre><code>capp config user.name "Your Name"</code></pre>You can also <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/objectivej/browse_thread/thread/75b268a8543b5258/884aeef09e2a4979">set up additional values</a>.  So now you're all set to start your first Cappuccino project. </div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-3089385311525845769?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
