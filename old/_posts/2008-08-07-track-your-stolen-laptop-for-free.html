Just a quick note: I just read about <a href="http://adeona.cs.washington.edu">Adeona</a>, a project from the University of Washington that lets you track a stolen laptop for free (of course you have to install it before you have someone steal it ;-)). The Mac OS version can even take snapshots of the thief with the iSight camera, like this one:<br/>
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://adeona.cs.washington.edu/adeonaimages/adeona-isight11.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http://adeona.cs.washington.edu/adeonaimages/adeona-isight11.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
I just installed it and I hope that I'll never need to use it. Having some hooded freak messing with my MacBook Pro is just a too terrible thought to bear.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4366452231084261097-5080993561414443147?l=blog.springenwerk.com' alt='' /></div>
