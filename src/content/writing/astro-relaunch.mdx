This is the obligatory "how I relaunched my website" article. When I started freelancing back in 2007, I started on [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/). In 2010, I moved to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) ([importing](https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/jfahrenkrug.github.com/commit/07bd8356c0fb5e0abcd1177e56a4823796371a3a#diff-33e908aa1b54cabb9d44a07309cc0890e24e45b9a36d72e4faa2c16eb2aefc38) all my content from Blogger). Jekyll and its dependencies got harder and harder to maintain and that led to [my last article](/2014/02/storyboardlint) being written more than 10 years ago, in 2014. I always loved writing, but I hated wrestling with dependencies and broken build processes just to write a new post.

So the search for something new began. I wanted it to be easy and low-friction to write. But I also wanted it to be customizable and I wanted to own my content - something I loved about Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I looked at [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) – nice clean interface, but felt like it was hemming me in too much. I looked at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) – I actually started converting to Gatsby, but then came across the easier and more powerful Astro. I thought about [Medium](https://medium.com/) – great social features and editor, but the constant paywalls were a no-go. Everything had its pros and cons.

Then a couple of years ago I came across [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it checked all the boxes: It had typing (something Ruby-based Jekyll was lacking), a great API, a simple approach to adding content, active community, great documentation, and full customizability when I wanted it.

So in 2023 I started to rebuild my site on top of Astro. I got pretty far, but then was pulled into some new projects and put it back on the backburner.

This weekend I finally decided to bring it across the finish line: With the help of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). It was a pure delight. Claude helped me to update from Astro 4 to 5, it helped me to create a [Speaking](/speaking) and [Writing](/writing) section. It helped me design (but not write!) my [About page](/about). It created the [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/jfahrenkrug.github.com/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to build and deploy my site. It was a fantastic companion in getting the styling of tables, callouts, code samples, lists, and anything else I wanted just right.

So take one last look at what my old website looked like:

You can look at the complete source code of my website and Astro setup on my public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/jfahrenkrug.github.com).

## Writing Features Showcase

One of the things I'm most excited about is how easy it now is to create articles that look exactly the way I want them to. Here's a showcase of the markdown features now available:

### Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks now have beautiful syntax highlighting with dual light/dark theme support:

```swift
class NetworkManager {
    private let session = URLSession.shared

    func fetchData<T: Codable>(from url: URL, type: T.Type) async throws -> T {
        let (data, _) = try await session.data(from: url)
        return try JSONDecoder().decode(type, from: data)
    }
}
```

### Callout Components

I can now easily use different types of callouts to highlight important information:

<Callout type="info" title="Information">
This is an informational callout. Perfect for providing additional context or helpful information.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Here's a helpful tip that can save you time or improve your workflow. These are great for sharing best practices!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Important Warning">
Use warning callouts to highlight potential pitfalls or important considerations that readers should be aware of.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Success">
Success callouts are perfect for highlighting positive outcomes, achievements, or when something works well.
</Callout>

### Enhanced Code Blocks

For more complex code examples, I can use the CodeBlock component with titles, filenames, and language labels:

<CodeBlock title="Custom Hook Implementation" language="typescript" filename="useLocalStorage.ts">

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T) {
    const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState<T>(() => {
        try {
            const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
            return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error reading localStorage key "${key}":`, error);
            return initialValue;
        }
    });

    const setValue = (value: T | ((val: T) => T)) => {
        try {
            const valueToStore = value instanceof Function ? value(storedValue) : value;
            setStoredValue(valueToStore);
            window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(valueToStore));
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error setting localStorage key "${key}":`, error);
        }
    };

    return [storedValue, setValue] as const;
}

export default useLocalStorage;
```

</CodeBlock>

### Lists and Tables

Lists now have proper styling with accent-colored markers:

**Unordered Lists:**
- Feature one
- Feature two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Feature three

**Ordered Lists:**
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

And tables have nice headers and styling:

| Feature | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Syntax Highlighting | ✅ | Via Shiki with dual themes |
| Callouts | ✅ | Five different types |
| Enhanced Code Blocks | ✅ | With titles and filenames |
| Tables | ✅ | With proper styling |
| Lists | ✅ | Accent-colored markers |

### Combining Elements

I can even combine callouts with code examples:

<Callout type="tip" title="Code Organization Best Practice">

When organizing your Swift code, consider using MARK comments:

```swift
// MARK: - Properties
private let networkManager: NetworkManager
private var isLoading = false

// MARK: - Initialization
init(networkManager: NetworkManager = .shared) {
    self.networkManager = networkManager
}

// MARK: - Public Methods
func loadData() async {
    // Implementation
}
```

This makes your code much more readable and maintainable!

I intend to write more and more often, now that it's frictionless and fun again!
