The Perceptron is one of the most important building blocks of modern AI.
Building one from scratch helped me to really understand how it - and many aspects of modern AI - actually work.

I will update this post soon, but for now I'd like to simply share three GitHub repos:

- [PerceptronViz](https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/PerceptronViz) is a SwiftUI macOS application that visualizes how a Perceptron works: Both the inference and training. It was created entirely by Claude Code and OpenAI Codex.

- [PerceptronPlayground](https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/PerceptronPlayground) is an Xcode Playground that shows how to build and train a Perceptron in pure Swift.
- [PerceptronFace](https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/PerceptronFace) is a fun commandline Swift application that re-creates the original Perceptron application from the 1950s: Classifying a photo of a human face as either male or female.

Have fun playing with these and I hope they help you to understand how a Perceptron works.
