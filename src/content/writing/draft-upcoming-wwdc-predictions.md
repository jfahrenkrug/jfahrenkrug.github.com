# WWDC 2024 Predictions: What to Expect from Apple

*Note: This is a draft article with my predictions for WWDC 2024. I'll update it after the conference with how accurate these predictions were.*

WWDC 2024 is just around the corner, and as someone who's been attending since 2007, I have some thoughts on what Apple might announce this year. Here are my predictions based on industry trends and what developers have been asking for.

## iOS 18: AI Integration and Customization

I expect iOS 18 to be the "AI release" where Apple finally responds to the ChatGPT revolution:

### Siri Gets Smarter
- Integration with large language models for more natural conversations
- Better context awareness across apps
- Improved voice recognition and response generation

### Developer AI Tools
- New Core ML models for common AI tasks
- Simplified APIs for integrating AI features
- On-device processing for privacy

### Customization Improvements
- More control over Control Center
- Additional lock screen customization options
- Possibly some home screen layout flexibility (though this is less likely)

## Xcode Updates

Xcode has been falling behind other IDEs in terms of AI assistance:

### AI-Powered Code Completion
- GitHub Copilot-style code suggestions
- Intelligent error fixing suggestions
- Automated test generation

### Performance Improvements
- Faster build times (please!)
- Better memory management
- More reliable debugging tools

## watchOS 11: Health and Fitness Focus

The Apple Watch continues to be Apple's health platform:

### New Health Metrics
- Blood pressure monitoring (hardware permitting)
- More detailed sleep analysis
- Stress monitoring improvements

### Fitness Enhancements
- New workout types
- Better third-party fitness app integration
- Improved metrics for runners and cyclists

## What I Hope to See (But Might Not)

### Developer Tools
- SwiftUI performance improvements
- Better debugging tools for Combine
- Improved Interface Builder (or its replacement)

### Platform Features
- Better multi-app workflows on iPad
- Improved external display support
- More flexible notification management

## My Track Record

For context, here's how my predictions have fared in recent years:
- **2023**: Got iOS customization wrong, but was right about health features
- **2022**: Correctly predicted M2 MacBooks, missed on some iOS features
- **2021**: Hit on privacy features, missed on some hardware predictions

## Conclusion

WWDC has become less predictable in recent years, which makes it more exciting. Apple seems more willing to surprise us, especially in the AI space where they've been quieter than competitors.

I'll be attending virtually this year and will update this article with my thoughts on how these predictions panned out. What are your predictions for WWDC 2024?
