The internet has been bursting at the seams with news about [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), the open-source personal AI assistant with super powers. I'm not quite ready to install it on my primary MacBook Pro yet, but I have an [Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/nano-super-developer-kit/) which seems like the perfect candidate for a test.

## Prerequisites

- If you want to install OpenClaw on a Jetson Orin Nano, you need a Jetson Orin Nano.
- You should have it set up already and have SSH access.
- You need access to some AI model, most likely API access or some subscription (OpenAI, Github Copilot, Anthropic, you name it).

## Update to the latest JetPack

SSH into your Nano and update to the latest version of JetPack (6.2.2 as of February 22, 2026). I followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIkjQn38no).

<Callout type="warning" title="Corrections to the Video">

Two notes for the video:
1. The correct command is `apt-mark showhold` instead of `apt-mark show hold`.
2. I had to edit `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-l4t-apt-source.list` instead of `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-apt-source.list`.

</Callout>

Feel free to also check out the [official Nvidia JetPack 6.2.2 upgrade instructions](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/jetpack-6-2-2-jetson-linux-36-5-is-now-live/359620).

So in my case all I had to do:

1. Run `sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-l4t-apt-source.list` and update all three occurrences of `36.4` to `36.5`. Save the file and exit the editor.
2. Run `sudo apt update`.
3. Run `sudo apt dist-upgrade`. This will take about 30 minutes or so. It will ask if you want to overwrite some config files. I looked at the diff for each using `D`, couldn't see any differences I wanted to preserve and then pressed `Y` to overwrite with the new version.
4. Run `sudo reboot` to reboot the machine. That's needed to actually upgrade the firmware.

## Install Node

The OpenClaw installer script claims to install everything (including Node), but in my case it didn't.
So I had to install Node 24 manually using NodeSource. I simply ran these two commands:

<CodeBlock title="Install Node via NodeSource" language="bash">

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_24.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

</CodeBlock>

Verify by running `node --version`. It should print `24.13.1` (or newer).

## Install Linuxbrew

Since OpenClaw uses brew to install dependencies, it's a good idea to already set up Linuxbrew before we start the OpenClaw installation.

Simply follow these steps:

<CodeBlock title="Install Linuxbrew" language="bash">

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential curl file git

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv bash)"
```

</CodeBlock>

Make sure it works: `brew doctor`.

## Install OpenClaw

I tried running the installer again, and it finished successfully but the openclaw command was not available and also didn't exist in `~/.npm-global/bin`.
I saw it spat out `inappropriate ioctl for device` during the install.

I found [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/23066) about the problem and then tried the suggested solution:

<CodeBlock title="Install OpenClaw (workaround)" language="bash">

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --no-gum
```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="success" title="That worked!">

The `--no-gum` flag bypasses the interactive terminal prompts that cause the ioctl error on the Jetson.

</Callout>

I then selected the Quickstart option and Copilot as my model/auth provider. I followed the GitHub Copilot auth-flow and then selected `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6`.

For channel I selected "Telegram (Bot API)" and followed the instructions to set up my lobster bot.

Next I selected "No" for "Configure skills now?". At this point things might look a bit different for you. At first run I had selected "Yes" for configuring the skills and had selected a few. Installation failed because I hadn't yet installed Linuxbrew. So I couldn't finish the initial onboarding all the way through.

<Callout type="tip" title="Finishing Setup After a Failed First Run">

I fixed that by running `openclaw config` and selected the sections I needed to finish setting up, especially "Channels". I selected Telegram again and at the same time started a chat on the Telegram app with the bot I had just created. The first DM triggered the bot to generate a pairing token. I had to run `openclaw pairing approve telegram <TOKEN>` to finish the connection.

</Callout>

After sending the first "Hello" to my OpenClaw installation, I saw that it worked:

So it was pretty easy to set up. It is currently installing whisper.cpp on my behalf so it can understand voice messages I send it. I'm curious to see how performant it will be on a Jetson Nano and how useful. Running it on a Mac enables a lot of extra capabilities. That's why quite a few people are buying dedicated Mac minis just to run OpenClaw. One of the next things I want to set up is headless Chrome with Playwright in order to use OpenClaw's web browsing capabilities. I'll update this as I learn more.
