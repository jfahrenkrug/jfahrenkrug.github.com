The Caltrain just left the Mountain View station, next stop is Palo Alto.<br />It's 6 AM, I've been up since 4:20.<br />It's a beautiful and clear morning. Through all the houses and trees I can get a glimpse of the spectacular sunrise now and then.<br />Once I arrive in San Francisco I'll just have to walk up 4th Street till Howard Street and I'll be at the Moscone Center.<br />Schedule for today: Pick up badge and wait in line for the keynote. Expectations for the keynote include a .Mac/web office partnership with Google, an iPhone SDK for 3rd party developers and - of course - an iPhone under everyone's seat.<br />After lunch I'll attend "Mac OS X State of the Union", "Coming to the Mac OS X Platform: Part 1 - The Mac OS X Architecture" and "Coming to the Mac OS X Platform: Part 2 - Frameworks, APIs and Tools". I'm sure it's going to be very interesting!
