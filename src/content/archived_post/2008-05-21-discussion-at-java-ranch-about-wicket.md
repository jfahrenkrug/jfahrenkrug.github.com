I've built a big Wicket online booking system back in 2006 using Java and <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Wicket</a>. Wicket is great. And I like it. I do. But recently I've fallen in love with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Well, over at Java Ranch Eelco Hillenius and Martijn Dashorst are answering questions about Wicket, promoting their book Wicket in Action. So I asked <a href="http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=83&amp;t=001417">whether Wicket or Ruby On Rails is the best fit for small web applications</a>. The answer is... interesting.
