<p>Last year I was able to <a href="http://www.iphone-developer-conference.de/History/IPDC-2011/Speaker/Fahrenkrug-Johannes">speak about Objective-C and Error and Exception Handling</a> at the German iPhone Developers Conference. For this year's conference, I have been asked to be <a href="http://www.iphone-developer-conference.de/Advisory-Board">part of the advisory board</a>. I'm really looking forward to it and I hope I can have a part in making this a great conference!</p>
