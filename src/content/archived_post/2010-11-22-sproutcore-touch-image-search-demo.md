<p>I have started to rediscover <a href="http://sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a>. It's been over 2 years since <a href="/2008/07/socialsprout-using-sproutcore-in.html">I last played around with it</a> and a lot has happened since. I'm <a href="http://www.iphonedevcon.de/02-Dezember.01dezember1.0.html">giving a talk about using SproutCore for iOS development next month</a> and I've built a demo application for it. It's a Google Image Search client that supports touch gestures to pinch and zoom the image and autorotation: So for best results try it out on your iPad.</p>

<p>Oh, and the <a href="https://github.com/jfahrenkrug/iphonedevcon2010-sproutcore-demo">code is on github</a>, of course!</p>
