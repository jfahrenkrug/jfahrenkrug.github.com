<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-wicket-did-not-make-the-grade.-p10972169.html">Interesting discussion</a> on the Wicket mailinglist about a team which decided to use Struts 2 instead of <a href="http://www.wicketframework.org">Wicket</a>. Quote:

<blockquote>Hi Florian,
To be honest, you should have titled this post "My team did not make the grade". There are many developers in the world whose skill and ambition rise little above cut and paste robot, and many burned out managers who have decided employees will never be capable of much else. Struts is a perfect framework choice where such conditions coincide. If you are in such a place right now, then for the love of all things holy, move on before your soul, and skills, languish. On the other hand, if you work for a place where the power of OOP is understood, and developer creativity is required and appreciated, Wicket will be the most natural choice.
