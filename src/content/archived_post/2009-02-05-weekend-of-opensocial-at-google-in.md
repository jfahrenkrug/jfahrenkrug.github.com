I got an email this week from <a href="http://maxmarmer.com/about/">Max Marmer</a>, on of the co-organizers for the <a href="http://weekendapps.com">weekend apps event</a> this February 20-22 at the Googleplex in Mountain View. Since I've written about OpenSocial before, he asked me to tell my readers (read: you and that guy in Montana) about this event. Here's his description:

<blockquote>Weekend apps is a 3 day hackathon for Open Social. We will begin Friday night, have a few keynote speeches, organize into teams and convene again on Sunday to share our work. We will offer technical help, source code, and a diverse array of developers, marketers and lawyers who can help you successfully launch your app.
The top four teams will each receive a million banner impressions and $100 gift certificates.</blockquote>
It sounds like fun! I'd like to go, but I won't fly from Germany to California for this, I'm already doing that in June for this year's WWDC :).
Oh, and Max was kind enough to throw in a 50% discount for the first 10 readers that would like to attend. Just <a href="mailto:maxmarmer@gmail.com">contact Max</a> to get the discount and tell him you read about the event here. They are close to capacity, so act quickly.
I was too slow to get a ticket to Scotland on Rails and I still cry myself to sleep about it every night. Don't make the same mistake.

<b>And if you happen to be willing to sell a spare ticket to Scotland on Rails, please leave a comment!</b>
