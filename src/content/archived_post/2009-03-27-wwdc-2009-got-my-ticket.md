This year, <a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/business/appleaday/blog/2009/03/whats_holding_up_the_announcem.html">Apple has waited excruciatingly long</a> to announce the dates for their annual <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc">Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)</a>. Last year they announced the dates on March 13th, 2 weeks earlier. Anyway, yesterday the dates were finally announced: June 8 - 12, just like <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/03/06/two_possible_dates_for_apples_wwdc_2009_emerge.html">everyone expected</a>. I got my ticket right away because WWDC sold out last year and I expect it to sell out even quicker this year because of all the new iPhone developers.
I really hope they won't just cater to new developers with lots of introductory sessions. But usually they have a good mix. It'll be good. See you there!
