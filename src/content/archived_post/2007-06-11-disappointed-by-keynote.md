Ok, I admit that this is a really crappy cellphone image, but I made it into the main keynote hall. The atmosphere was great and it was a lot of fun. The new Leopard features, like the new Desktop, the new Finder and all is really nice and impressive. But nothing REALLY groundbreaking was announced. The biggest disappointment was the announcement that the iPhone will only be able to run 3rd party apps through... web apps. Web apps that you pull up in the iPhone Safari browser. That really wasn't big news: The iPhone has a browser, so of course you can use web applications. What if you're offline and what about all the developers that make games for cellphones and everything? Well, we'll have to wait and see, but in my opinion it's not a great move. As a developer I want to be able to really develop real applications for the iPhone.<br />I just had lunch and the next session is going to be "Mac OS X State of the Union".
