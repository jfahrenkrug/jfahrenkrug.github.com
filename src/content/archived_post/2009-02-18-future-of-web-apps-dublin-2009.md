Hi fellow <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEzGIuY7kw">nerds</a>. Scotland on Rails was sold out before I could get a ticket, but I'll be at <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2009/dublin">FOWA Dublin</a> next month. The <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2009/dublin/schedule">lineup looks great</a> and I'm sure we'll have a blast! Who else is coming? It would be great to meet up.
