I've spent this morning building a small OpenSocial application. It's called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-friendscolor/">Color of my Friends</a>. It is rather simple: You choose a color from red, green, or blue and so do your friends. The widget then builds an RGB color index from the colors your friends have chosen. If you have 10 friends, for example and 3 choose red, 2 choose green and 5 choose blue, you'll get the color code #4C337F which would look like this:

   <div style="width: 150px; height: 50px; background-color: rgb(76, 51, 127);"></div>
So this was fun to build and feel free to check out the code on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-friendscolor/">project website</a> or add the gadget xml to your Orkut or MySpace or whatever opensocial container sandbox: http://opensocial-friendscolor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/friendscolor.xml

Enjoy!
