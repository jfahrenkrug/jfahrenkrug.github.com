<img src="http://developer.apple.com/images_index/iphone_sdk.png" style="margin: 10px 10px 0pt 0pt; float: left;" title="iphone sdk" alt="" />I came back from the movies yesterday night (watched Michael Clayton, highly recommended!) and after putting together a piece of furniture from IKEA at 11:30 pm I remembered the iPhone Roadmap event that took place while I was at the movies. So I had to <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/keynote/">watch the Quicktime stream</a> of the event. Very, very cool. VERY cool. The stuff EA and Sega got done in just 2 weeks is incredible. I've developed on the Mac with Cocoa before and it's just a joy to work with. Being able to use the same great XCode tools and even the debugging instruments for remote debugging is more I dared to hope for.
So I can't wait to start playing with it this weekend. I've already downloaded the SDK and checked out some of the tutorial videos on ADC on iTunes. I was laying awake in bed till 2 am thinking about the cool things I could build :). The only thing missing yesterday: An announcement of this years WWDC dates!
