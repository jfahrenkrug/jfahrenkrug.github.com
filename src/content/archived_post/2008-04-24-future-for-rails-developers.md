<img src="http://engineyard.com/images/logo.gif" style="margin: 10px 10px 0pt 0pt; float: left;" title="engine yard logo" alt="engine yard logo" />I just listened to an <a href="http://www.ddj.com/linux-open-source/207400977">interesting podcast interview with Tom Mornini</a>, the CTO of <a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>. In it he talks a bit about what his company does and the challenges of scalable Rails deployment, but the bit I found especially interesting is what he had to say about Rails developers. He said that there is a huge demand for them and that new developers can't be taught quickly enough to fill that need. He says that it's going to be a multi year process to teach enough developers to satisfy the demand the market has for them.
I guess that puts us Rails developers in a cozy position :)

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Thank you for your feedback, Tom! I'd be very interested to know what you think about Google App Engine, esp. if they should add Ruby and Rails support in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Glad you enjoyed the Podcast, it was the first time I've ever done something like that.<BR/><BR/>Ruby and Rails developers are, indeed, in a comfortable position. We see continued strong adoptions amongst large and small companies alike!</p>
