For quite a while I've been working with <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">Google OpenSocial</a> on both Orkut and MySpace. Development is a little tedious because you always have to upload your code changes and then refresh the OpenSocial gadget in the container (MySpace for example) to try it out. Yesterday Justin mentioned something interesting in a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-api/browse_thread/thread/12324ef0fc807d9b/9c28c9bfe0c085e5#9c28c9bfe0c085e5">posting on the OpenSocial group</a>. It's called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/happyhour/">Happyhour</a> and it's an OpenSocial container implemented in JavaScript and <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a>. It implements the 0.7 OpenSocial specs. You don't need any server and can locally test your OpenSocial gadgets, which is really nifty!<br />Here's a short video chat with it's creator, Chandra Patni:<br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6NhdXm9197s"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6NhdXm9197s" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object><p class="citation"><cite cite="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NhdXm9197s"></cite></p><p class="citation"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><br /><cite cite="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NhdXm9197s"></cite></p><br />So how do you get it to work? Easy:<br /><ol><br /><li>Go to <a href="http://gears.google.com">Google Gears</a> and install it.</li><br /><li>Go to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/happyhour/">Happyhour</a> and download the latest release and unpack it.</li><br /><li>Now open the index.html and you'll be greeted with this screen:<br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="/assets/archived_posts/Picture+3_850c1961.png" border="0" /><br /><br />So it really works beautifully! I'm surprised this great tool slipped under my radar for so long.<br />Please tell me how you use Happyhour and what caveats and workarounds you've found.
