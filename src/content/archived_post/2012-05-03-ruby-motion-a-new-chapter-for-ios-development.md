<p>Ruby is one of my favorite programming languages. For a while I have been following and using <a href="http://macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>. So naturally I am very excited about the launch of <a href="http://rubymotion.com">RubyMotion</a>: MacRuby for iOS development! Spearheaded by the brilliant Laurent Sansonetti, it is a project you should definitely check out! I was involved in much of the beta testing period and was asked to contribute <a href="https://github.com/HipByte/RubyMotionSamples/tree/master/Trollify">one of the official sample projects</a>. I wish Laurent all the best with his exciting start-up!</p>
