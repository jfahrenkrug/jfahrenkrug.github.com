WWDC 2008 is less than a week away! I'll leave from Hamburg this Friday morning and will be in San Francisco on Friday evening. I'll be staying with wonderful friends of mine in Milpitas and I'll be taking the Caltrain to the city every morning. That's what I did last year, too.

The tickets are cheap ($7.50 one way) and you meet so many interesting people that are attending WWDC on the train. Last year I had great on-train-conversations with an Apple GCC Engineer (now that's a cool title to have on your business card) and an engineer who worked on iChat AV (no, I didn't ask him why the "background detection" doesn't work right). So I'm curious who I'll meet this year.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">So, what sessions will I attend?</span>
Like most people, I'm interested in iPhone development, of course. So these are the sessions I think I'll attend:

There are 3 interesting sessions in the first time slot and I haven't decided yet:
<ul><li>Either Getting Started with Instruments (I attended a similar session last year, but a refresher might be good)...</li><li>...or Internationalizing Your Software...</li><li>...or Core Animation Techniques for iPhone and Mac</li><li>iPhone Multi-Touch Events and Gestures</li><li>Creating Efficient Data Models with Core Data</li></ul><span style="color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Wednesday Evening</span>
<ul><li>Apple Design Awards</li><li>Stump the Experts</li></ul>Wednesday night I'll sleep in a hotel in the city... this year it's hopefully not in an area where I have to be afraid to get shot when I walk there in the dark... <a href="http://www.baybridgeinn.com/">like last year</a>.

<span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">Thursday Morning</span>

<ul><li>Either Cocoa Tips and Tricks: Using Leopard Features Effectively...</li><li>...or Mastering Interface Builder</li><li>Debugging and Profiling Your iPhone Application
</li></ul><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">Thursday Afternoon</span>
<ul><li>Mastering iPhone View Controllers</li><li>Polishing Your Cocoa Application</li><li>iPhone Device APIs: Location, Accelerometer, and Camera</li></ul><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">Thursday Evening</span>
<ul><li>WWDC Bash at Yerba Buena Gardens, San Francisco
This is a video of last year's bash. Notice how none of us geeks are moving to the music:

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Friday Morning</span>
<ul><li>Either Mastering iPhone Table Views...</li><li>...or Building Native Look-and-Feel Web Applications Using <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">SproutCore</a></li></ul><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Friday Afternoon</span>
Most Friday afternoon sessions are a bit lame because some people leave early and everyone's brains are already smoking. So the best session so far seems to be
<ul><li>Either Accessing Contacts and Calendars on Leopard...</li><li>...or Improving Responsiveness in Websites and Web Applications</li></ul>So, a very interesting week is laying ahead for all of us coming to San Francisco this year. Please drop me a line if you'll be there too so we can meet up.
