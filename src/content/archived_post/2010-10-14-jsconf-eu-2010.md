<p>I was able to attend <a href="http://jsconf.eu">JSConf EU 2010</a> last month. It was one of the best conferences I have ever attended. The quality of most talks was outstanding. The conference was also quite small so that you had a chance to actually talk to the people you wanted to meet. <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a> gave a <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/loopage_by_douglas_crockford.html">talk</a>, as did the creator of JavaScript himself, <a href="http://brendaneich.com/">Brendan Eich</a> and <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/using_the_web_to_deliver_the_n.html">Dion Almear and Ben Galbraith</a> of the palm webOS project.</p>
<p>Other talks I immensly enjoyed were <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/getting_functional_with_fab.html">&quot;Getting Functional with (fab)&quot;</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/jedschmidt">Jed Schmidt</a>. His slides were absolutely exceptional and the talk was both very entertaining and fascinatingly detailed. You can <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/getting_functional_with_fab.html">watch his talk here</a>. If you haven't checked out <a href="http://github.com/jed/fab">(fab)</a> yet, you should do so right now!</p>
<p><a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/oh_no_not_again.html">&quot;The Front-end Takeover&quot;</a> by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aq">Aaron &quot;That Bacon Guy&quot; Quinn</a> was - as expected - both entertaining and insightful. It was nice to meet Aaron in person at the pre conference <a href="http://codefoodbar.org/">code food bar</a> event.</p>
<p><a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/the_jquery_divide_by_rebecca_m.html">&quot;The jQuery Divide&quot;</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/rmurphey">Rebecca Murphey</a> showed how it is important to actually learn and use JavaScript and not just a framework.</p>
<p>Another absolute highlight was <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/lessons_learnt_pushing_browser.html">&quot;Lessons learnt pushing browsers to the limit&quot;</a>  by <a href="http://twitter.com/bfirsh">Ben Firshman</a>. Juicy details about performance issues and solutions learnt while porting an <a href="http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/">NES Emulator to JavaScript</a>. Wonderful. This is the kind of stuff I attend conferences for :).</p>
<p>While Tobias Schneider's (of <a href="http://wiki.github.com/tobeytailor/gordon/">Gordon</a> fame) talk <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/not_your_mothers_javascript.html">&quot;Not your Mother's JavaScript!&quot;</a> was definitely interesting, I wish he would have shown more examples and more cool stuff. Maybe my expectations were just too high.</p>
<p>Another fantastic talk was <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/socketio_websockets_for_everyo.html">&quot;Socket.IO: WebSockets for everyone&quot;</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/rauchg">Guillermo Rauch</a>. <a href="http://github.com/learnboost/socket.io">Socket.IO</a> is a library that enables websockets for (almost) every browser, even IE 5.5(!). A fantastic talk about an equally fantastic library. Definitely check out the <a href="http://github.com/guille/jsconf-todo-demo">demo code</a> for this talk.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mutle">Mutwin Kraus</a>' talk about <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/using_to_develop_classic_2d_ga.html">&quot;Using canvas to develop classic 2D games&quot;</a> was both interesting and practical. Mutwin talked about <a href="http://github.com/mutle/jsscummvm">JSScummVM</a>, canvas, sprites and masking. Good stuff!</p>
<p>Of course the final talk by Chris Williams - <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/communityjs_by_chris_williams.html">&quot;community.js&quot;</a> was very powerful and introduced the <a href="http://promotejs.com/">Promote.JS</a> project to improve JavaScript documentation visibility. A very good idea.</p>
<p>So what's left to say? I can't wait for JSConf.eu 2011!</p>
