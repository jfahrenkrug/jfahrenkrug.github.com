Textmate just informed me of a new version being available. I installed it and the changelog showed a new bundle for the <a href="http://programming.nu">Nu programming language</a>. It's a Lisp and Ruby-like language (everything is an object) written in Objective-C. It looks extremely interesting and promising. I'll have to check it out as soon as I have time (yeah right, as if that's ever gonna happen).
Ok, take a look at this <a href="http://programming.nu/posts/2007/11/25/a-delicious-nu-screencast">short screencast first</a>. Isn't that unbelievably cool?
Then, if you have about 50 minutes, take a look at this video where Nu was introduced to the world:

<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" id="viddler" height="370" width="437"><param name="movie" value="http://www.viddler.com/player/f15b6262/"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><embed src="http://www.viddler.com/player/f15b6262/" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" name="viddler" height="370" width="437"></object>

This really has the potential to revolutionize Cocoa and Obj-C development on the Mac. Amazing.

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Hi Johannes,<BR/><BR/>while the Nu Programming Language looks very interesting, I think that another language has much more potential to revolutionize Cocoa and Objective-C development on the Mac: MacRuby. As far as I know, it is the only language besides Objective-C running on the Objective-C runtime that is "a free software project by Apple Inc." (quote from the MacRuby homepage).</p>
