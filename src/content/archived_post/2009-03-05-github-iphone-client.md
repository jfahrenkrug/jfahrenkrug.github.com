Wow, that was quick! It took only 6 days (or 4 work days) for <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/gittop">my iPhone app</a> to be reviewed and approved by Apple. It's my 3rd iPhone app, but my first own, not-for-a-customer app. Very exciting :)
It's called "<a href="http://itunes.com/apps/gittop">gittop</a>" and it's the first (to the best of my knowledge) <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> client for the iPhone. It was developed with the kind support of github's own <a href="http://github.com/defunkt">Chris Wanstrath</a> who patiently answered my github API questions and tested the beta version. Thanks, Chris!
