I now I'm a couple of days late, but I just read the <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/04/introducing-google-app-engine-our-new.html">blog post about Google App Engine</a>. It seems to be something that every web application developer has dreamed of: You just have to write your code and then deploy it with a single command, without worrying about setting up the machine, the server, the DB, and all the other stuff that we as developers rather not get our hands dirty with. Google App Engine lets you do the coding and Google do the rest: You can run your app on Google infrastructure with scaling and all. That's really cool!
And the best thing is that the first language it supports in Python. You can use the full language <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html#libraries">with some limitations</a>. But there's more: The SDK comes with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>! Since working with Rails I have always been wanting to check out Django and now I have even more reason to do so. There is an <a href="http://www.42topics.com/dumps/django/docs.html">interesting tutorial about building a Django project with App Engine</a> and another <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-django-guestbook/">App Engine Django demo from Google</a>. But that's still not all: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTFL7FPLnXY">Guido van Rossum</a> is a member of the App Engine development team! Oh, and it's free to start with. They'll charge you if you need more horse power, though.
Here's a short demo video of how easy it is to build an app with App Engine. I have to say that the webapp package doesn't seem to be too pretty to use, but the good thing is that you don't have to! I'd rather stick with Django.

So whenever I have a great idea for a web application again, worrying about deployment and all that stuff shouldn't discourage me anymore!
