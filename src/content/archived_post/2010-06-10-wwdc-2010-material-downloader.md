<p>If you are attending <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc">WWDC 2010</a> you no doubt want to get a hold of all the great sample code and session material. I've written a script that will download it all for you and organize it in folders for each session. You can <a href="http://github.com/jfahrenkrug/wwdc2010-material-downloader">download it here on github</a>. Enjoy and see you next year.</p>
