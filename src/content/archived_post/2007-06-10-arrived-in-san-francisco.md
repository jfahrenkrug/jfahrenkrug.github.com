After being up for 23 hours I finally arrived in San Francisco. The trip was smooth and I met a girl who's learning German sign language, a scientist heading to a conference in San Diego (who happened to be a Mac user) and a professor who can read Hebrew. Lots of interesting people.
Close friends of mine from San Jose picked me up and our first stop was <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-N-Out Burger</a> - one of the best burger joints in California.
Tomorrow I have one more day to spend with my friends and relax a bit before the WWDC starts on Monday!
