I stumbled upon <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rhino-on-rails.html">this cool post</a> by a Googler named Steve Yegge about porting Ruby on Rails to server-side JavaScript using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Mozilla Rhino</a> running on the JVM. Really cool. Watch the interview:


   <object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1QD9XQm_Jd4&amp;rel=1"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1QD9XQm_Jd4&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object>

Both the post and the video give a very interesting look at the inner workings of Google but much more importantly at the power of JavaScript. Since the rise of AJAX JavaScript is taken a lot more seriously and a lot of smart people have shown how powerful it really is. Rhino on Rails seems to really take it to the next level. It will be very fascinating to see what will come out of this.
