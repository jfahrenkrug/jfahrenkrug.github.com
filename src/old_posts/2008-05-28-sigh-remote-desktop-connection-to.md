This is just a short post of frustration: I needed to connect to a Windows Terminal Server today. There is a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads.mspx">RDC Client for the Mac by Microsoft</a>. But when I wanted to connect, I got this error:<br /><br />get CoRD</a> and be happy.

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Works for me! I am connecting to a windows 2000 Terminal server. Only one issue is that the keybaord didn&#39;t work to start, but playing in the prefferences (and restarting the app) seems to have fixed that. The only other issue is that the color pallet it a bit off, but I don&#39;t care. Thanks!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Nope, no love from CoRD, just opens a window and disconnects with no error message...</p>
