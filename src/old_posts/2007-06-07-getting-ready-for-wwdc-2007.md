On Saturday I'm going to fly to San Francisco to attend <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC 2007</a> next week. It's my first time, so I'm pretty excited.  I'm gonna meet <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/instructors/hillegass.shtml">Aaron Hillegass</a>, author of the great book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321213149">Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</a>". He already told me in an email that he's gonna be hard to miss: He's very tall and he'll be wearing a big cowboy hat.
My electronic WWDC ticket gives me access to some pre-conference developer resources, among which is a 5.4 GB disc image of Mac OS Leopard. I installed it on my iBook yesterday (yes, it works on "old" PPC hardware). Since it's covered by an NDA, I won't say much about it... well, even if I wanted to I couldn't say much because I've only played around with it for a few minutes. Some features, like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html">Spaces</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> are no secret anymore and they do look pretty nice.
Well, the installation went very smooth and I'm sure a few really cool features will be announced next week when the full feature beta will be handed out to the attendees.
I'll try to post some interesting updates every day!
