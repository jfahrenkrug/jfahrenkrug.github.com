So I've been getting my feet wet with OpenSocial for a while now, both on MySpace and on Orkut. I've only signed up with MySpace because I needed an account to develop and test my OpenSocial application. But since then I've got to learn that - from a developer's perspective - MySpace is really cool. The guys there are very active in the forums to help developers and they actually listen to what we want. Oh, and they use Scrum, too. 
Today I found this <a href="http://developer.myspace.com/community/myspace/videoarchive.aspx">great series of videos about OpenSocial in general and OpenSocial on MySpace</a>, presented by MySpace's own Chief Software Architect Chris Bissell. The videos are very interesting and entertaining. The way he talks reminds me a bit of the Comic Book Guy on the Simpsons. Notice the occasional random mad scientist "hee hee" laugh. Great stuff.

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Thank you for your feedback as well, Rhonda. It's really nice to see that you're reading this ;-)<BR/><BR/>I can only imagine what a mammoth project it must be to get the opensocial support off the ground. It would be great if you guys would organize a MySpace developer day in Europe (preferably Germany ;-)), or some hackathons.<BR/><BR/>- Johannes</p>
