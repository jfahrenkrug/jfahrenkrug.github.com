I'm back from vacation! I was able to have some wonderful days with my wife in the Bavarian Alps. It's a gorgeous area and we had a wonderful time. Even the weather was great! If you ever happen to be in southern Bavaria, make sure to eat at the "<a href="http://www.gasthof-goldener-baer.de/">Goldener BÃ¤r</a>" in Berchtesgaden!
I'm not back home yet, though: I'm attending the <a href="http://www.systems.de">Systems 2007</a> trade fair in Munich. I'm part of the <a href="http://www.thomas-krenn.com">Thomas-Krenn.AG</a> booth to promote their plans to offer web application security services. I will be here until Friday, possibly only Thursday.
I will be back in Bavaria in two weeks, though, to give a <a href="http://www.thomas-krenn.com/de/news-jobs/security-day.html">talk about web application security</a> at the Thomas-Krenn.AG headquarters on November 14th.
