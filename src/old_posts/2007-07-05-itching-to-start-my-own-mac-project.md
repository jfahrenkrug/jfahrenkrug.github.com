I have a few ideas and developing on the Mac is just simply something beautiful.
My itch just got stronger because I read <a href="http://developer.apple.com/business/macmarket/checkout.html">an interesting article</a> about a software company from Amsterdam over on the ADC site. The company is called "<a href="http://www.madebysofa.com/">madebysofa</a>" and they developed a point-of-sale application for the Mac, called <a href="http://www.checkoutapp.com/">Checkout</a>. The interesting thing is that they used Python and the <a href="http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/">PyObjC bridge</a> for a commercial product. Maybe that's not uncommon, but I haven't heard of it yet. I love Python and believe that it's a great language and as they said in the article: Developing on the Mac AND with Python is the best of both worlds... Itch, itch, itch!!!
