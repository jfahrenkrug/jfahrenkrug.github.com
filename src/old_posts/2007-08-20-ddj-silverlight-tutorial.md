When it comes to Microsoft they don't seem too objective to me at all times but I do think that <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> is pretty cool so I don't really care this time.
What they did is put together an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid">Arkanoid</a> clone using Silverlight and they tell you step by step how they did it. They also linked to the <a href="http://ddjsilverlight.com/tutorial/images/dev_reference.png">Microsoft Silverlight Developer Reference</a> (a big, insightful, and pretty picture). I haven't worked through the tutorial yet, but I'll make sure to check it out as soon as I have time.
