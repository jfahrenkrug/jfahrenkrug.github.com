Better late than never: My recap of the fifth and last day of WWDC08. I'm back in Germany already and WWDC has ended almost a week ago. It was great! I learned a lot about iPhone development, started working on two applications in the breaks, during some sessions and on the train and plane. Putting to use what I've learned is one of the best ways to really remember and understand this stuff.
After the conference I was able to spend a couple of days with good friends of mine from the Bay Area and that's why I didn't get around to write this earlier.
So what sessions did I attend on Friday?

The first morning session was one of my absolute conference highlights: Building Native Look-and-Feel Web Applications Using SproutCore. Please <a href="http://blog.springenwerk.com/2008/06/sproutcore-javascript-on-rails-drinking.html">read my article about this amazing new JavaScript framework</a>. Especially read it if you're thinking "Oh no, not another JavaScript framework!"
After that I went to the "How Do I Do That? Tips and Tricks for iPhone Application Development" session. Very informative and the extensive Q&A provided a wealth of information.
After lunch my last session of this year's WWDC was "Mastering Advanced Objective-C Features": very in-depth and a lot of advanced things were to be learned. Nice. That's how WWDC ended for me. All in all a wonderful conference. I can't wait to put all this stuff to use.
I'll be back. Next year.
