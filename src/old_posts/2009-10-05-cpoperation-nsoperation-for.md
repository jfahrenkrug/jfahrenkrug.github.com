<b>Update: </b>CPOperation is now <a href="http://twitter.com/jfahrenkrug/status/6969965805">an official part of Cappuccino</a> (yay!).<br />
<br />
This a just a short public service announcement: I've finished porting NSOperation, NSOperationQueue, NSInvocationOperation and NSBlockOperation to Objective-J. I've called it <a href="http://github.com/jfahrenkrug/CPOperation">"CPOperation" and you can get it on github</a>. You can learn something about unit test in Objective-J there as well, because I wrote tests for all the classes.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!
